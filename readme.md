# Solana Development 90-Day Challenge üöÄ

## Challenge Overview
I am committing to a **90-day challenge** to master **Solana development** using **Rust**. Every day, I will work on Solana smart contracts (programs), explore its architecture, and commit my progress to GitHub.

## Challenge Goals
- Gain expertise in **Solana development** using **Rust**.
- Learn **Solana‚Äôs architecture, accounts, and runtime**.
- Build **on-chain programs** and interact with them using **Anchor & Solana SDK**.
- Develop **real-world decentralized applications (DApps)**.
- Explore **Solana security and best practices**.
- Document daily progress for consistency and learning.

## Progress Log üìÖ
| Day | Date       | Activity                                                                     | Key Learnings                                         |
| --- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | YYYY-MM-DD | Setup Solana CLI, installed Rust, explored Solana program structure.         | Learned Solana architecture and CLI setup.            |
| 2   | YYYY-MM-DD | Built and deployed a basic Solana program.                                   | Understood Solana accounts and transactions.          |
| 3   | YYYY-MM-DD | Studied **PDAs (Program Derived Addresses)** and wrote a program using PDAs. | Understood PDAs and their role in Solana development. |
| 4   | YYYY-MM-DD | Implemented basic token transfer program using **Token Program**.            | Learned SPL token mechanics.                          |
| 5   | YYYY-MM-DD | Explored **Anchor framework**, rewrote previous programs in Anchor.          | Improved development workflow with Anchor.            |
